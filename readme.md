### The Project

This is the code for the Octopus game! It was inspired by Nintendo's 1981 Game & Watch game of the same name. In it you play as a diver trying to reach sunken treasure to bring it back to shore. However, an octopus impedes your wealth! Avoid the tentacles of the octopus, claim your prize, and make it safely back to your boat!

#### How to Play

(1) press any button to start the game
(2) use the left and right buttons to navigate
(3) avoid the tentacles of the octopus
(4) reach the treasure and back to earn points
